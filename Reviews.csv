1,1,Paul Prudhomme makes great seafood seasoning and pork and veal seasoning. This's my second order. I found their Vegetable Seasoning are too spicy and hot compared to the last one I bought.
3,1,"I finally found a renal cat food that my cat likes, and they change the formula.  Why's that? To defend her pickiness, Sabrina has had renal disease for 6.5 years.  I brought her to vet from time to time. She's been through all the mainstream renal cat foods and sooner or later, tired of each of them. No going back, either.  That's too bad. I read good reviews about Hi-Tor Neo Diet early this year, and ordered a case.  She SCARFED that food down.  I dont know why. Things went along swimmingly until my last order. New label, new size, new consistency, doesn't smell the same. What's going on? Why did you change everything?"
5,2,"i bought 80 bucks worth of this because of the other reviews of this product. I hoped my cat loved it, but she won't eat it. period. so just like in people, taste is subjective. buy a small amount and try it out first. hopefully your cat will love it. i'm sure it is a good product quality-wise, which is why i didn't rate it lower. I cannot rate better than that."
6,1,"My vet says my cat is in the beginning stage of CRF. So that is why I've been changing his diet from dry Science Diet K/D to wet.  I didn't know what to buy so checked all other reviews. Everything I've been reading says wet food is best as long as it is human grade. Looked nice. Unfortunatly, he won't eat the HI-Tor. Now I'm stuck with a case of it.  Sign.... It should be sold in smaller quantities for trial purposes. I didn't order in bulk."
7,1,"My cat wouldn't even touch this. He tried actually, but after he sniffed it, and then he looked at me, and tried to bury it. I guess he wanted to hide it from me. And I tried on three different occasions, thinking that maybe his belly was just upset that day from the CRF. But he never would eat it.  Now, I've got a case of it.  Guess I'll donate it to the local animal shelter. Hope this helps."
